#summary Documents all the changes that were made to every version of the library

= 0.4.1 =

 * Tweaked POM file for inclusion in Maven Central.
 * Removed the `getType()` and `setType()` methods from the `ImppType` class.  These methods were not necessary because `ImppType` inherits from `MultiValuedTypeParameterType`.

= 0.4.0 =

 * Added support for [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6473 RFC 6473] (KIND:application)
 * Added support for [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6474 RFC 6474] (BIRTHPLACE, DEATHPLACE, DEATHDATE)
 * Added support for [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6715 RFC 6715] (Open Mobile Alliance Converged Address Book extensions)
 * Added convenience methods to `VCard` class for reading/writing xCards.
 * Fixed bug in the RELATED property that prevented URI values from being read.
 * Multiple instances of the BDAY and ANNIVERSARY properties can now be added to the `VCard` object.  This is necessary because these properties support the ALTID parameter.

= 0.3.0 =

 * +Added support for [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6351 xCard] (an XML representation for vCards).
 * +Added the `SkipMeException`, which can be thrown from a type class's marshal or unmarshal methods.  If thrown from a marshal method, it will prevent the property from being marshalled.  If thrown from an unmarshal method, it will prevent the type object from being added to the `VCard` object.
 * +Added logic to the `EMAIL` and `TEL` properties to determine whether to use the "`TYPE=pref`" or "`PREF=1`" parameter (depending on the vCard version) when marshalling.
 * @Fixed the `TYPE` parameter of the `RELATED` property so that it is (1) optional and (2) multi-valued.
 * @Fixed the `GEO` property so it properly marshals/unmarshals its value for 4.0 vCards.
 * @Fixed the `VCard` object so it no longer is missing getters/setters for the `GENDER` property.
 * -Removed the "guava" dependency.
 * -Removed the "commons-io" dependency.

= 0.2.0 =

 * Added support for vCard 4.0
 * Removed the space that ez-vcard added after the colon in the marshalled vCard.  This prevented some mail clients from reading the vCard (see Issue 1).
 * Values for the BEGIN, END, and PROFILE types are now in upper-case (i.e. "BEGIN:VCARD").  The 2.1/3.0 specs appear to require it to be in upper-case, so better safe than sorry (see Issue 1).
 * Fleshed out the Javadocs.

= 0.1.1 =

  * Removed SLF4J dependency.
  * Modified `VCard` class to only allow one UID type in accordance with the specs.
  * Binary vCard types such as PHOTO and LOGO now use the proper ENCODING value when marshalled ("base64" for 2.1 and "b" for 3.0). 
  * Renamed `DisplayableNameType` class to `SourceDisplayTextType`.
  * Renamed `OrgType` class to `OrganizationType`.
