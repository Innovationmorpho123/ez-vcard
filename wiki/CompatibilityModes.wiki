#summary Compatibility modes allow the library to deal with quirks found in vCards generated by certain mail clients, such as Outlook or GMail.

In the case that a vCard generated by a specific application breaks the standard in some major way, EZ-vCard provides "compatibility modes" to handle these quirks.  To specify a compatibility mode when reading a vCard, use the `VCardReader.setCompatibilityMode()` method.

{{{
Reader reader = ...
VCardReader vcr = new VCardReader(reader);
vcr.setCompatibilityMode(CompatibilityMode.KDE_ADDRESS_BOOK);
VCard vcard = vcr.readNext();
}}}

Compatibility modes can also be applied when writing a vCard.  This will cause EZ-vCard to generate a vCard specifically targetted for that application.  Use the `VCardWriter.setCompatibilityMode()` method to define a compatibility mode.

{{{
VCard vcard = ...
Writer writer = ...
VCardWriter vcw = new VCardWriter(writer);
vcw.setCompatibilityMode(CompatibilityMode.KDE_ADDRESS_BOOK);
vcw.write(vcard);
}}}

EZ-vCard contains the following compatibility modes.

 * `CompatibilityMode.KDE_ADDRESS_BOOK`
   * KDE Address Book uses an escaped comma character ("`\,`") as the delimitor for the items in the CATEGORIES property.  However, the vCard standard requires that an *unescaped* comma character ("`,`") be used as a delimiter.  This compatibility mode will cause EZ-vCard to use an escaped comma character as the delimitor instead of an unescaped comma character when reading/writing CATEGORIES properties (credit: [https://sourceforge.net/projects/cardme CardMe project]).

=Other quirks=

Some quirks can be handled by EZ-vCard automatically and *do not require* the use of a compatibility mode (credit to  [https://sourceforge.net/projects/cardme CardMe project] for many of these).

 * *Microsoft Outlook*
   * QUOTED-PRINTABLE property values are incorrectly folded.
 * *iPhone*
   * Every other line is empty.
   * Colon characters are escaped in property values. Even though colons have a special meaning in the vCard standard, they don't have to be escaped within a property value.
 * *GMail*
   * Colon characters are escaped in property values. Even though colons have a special meaning in the vCard standard, they don't have to be escaped within a property value.
 * *Mac Address Book*
   * Colon characters are escaped in property values. Even though colons have a special meaning in the vCard standard, they don't have to be escaped within a property value.
 * *Kontact 4.4.8*
   * Requires that there be no whitespace after the colon in the BEGIN property when reading a vCard (credit: [http://code.google.com/p/ez-vcard/issues/detail?id=1&can=1 knutolav]).
