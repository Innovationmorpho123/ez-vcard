#summary Compatibility modes allow ez-vcard to deal with quirks found in vCards generated by certain mail clients, such as Outlook or GMail.

Occasionally, an application that deals with vCards, such as an email client or address book utility, will break the vCard standard in some way.  This can happen when generating vCards or when reading vCards.  ez-vcard provides "compatibility modes" to handle these quirks.  The `setCompatibilityMode()` method can be used to specify a compatibility mode when reading or writing a vCard.

{{{
//reading a vCard generated by KDE Address Book
Reader reader = ...
VCardReader vcr = new VCardReader(reader);
vcr.setCompatibilityMode(CompatibilityMode.KDE_ADDRESS_BOOK);
VCard vcard = vcr.readNext();
}}}

{{{
//creating a vCard specially designed for KDE Address Book
VCard vcard = ...
Writer writer = ...
VCardWriter vcw = new VCardWriter(writer);
vcw.setCompatibilityMode(CompatibilityMode.KDE_ADDRESS_BOOK);
vcw.write(vcard);
}}}

=List of compatibility modes=

ez-vcard contains the following compatibility modes.

 * `CompatibilityMode.KDE_ADDRESS_BOOK`
   * KDE Address Book uses an escaped comma character ("`\,`") as the delimitor for the items in the CATEGORIES property.  However, the vCard standard requires that an *unescaped* comma character ("`,`") be used as a delimiter.  This compatibility mode will cause ez-vcard to use an escaped comma character as the delimitor instead of an unescaped comma character when reading/writing CATEGORIES properties (credit: [https://sourceforge.net/projects/cardme CardMe project]).

=Quirks which do not require a compatibility mode=

Some quirks can be handled by ez-vcard automatically.  They do not require the use of a compatibility mode.

 * *Microsoft Outlook*
   * QUOTED-PRINTABLE property values are incorrectly folded (credit: [https://sourceforge.net/projects/cardme CardMe project]).
 * *iPhone*
   * Every other line is empty (credit: [https://sourceforge.net/projects/cardme CardMe project]).
   * Colon characters are unnecessarily escaped in property values (credit: [https://sourceforge.net/projects/cardme CardMe project]).
 * *GMail*
   * Colon characters are unnecessarily escaped in property values (credit: [https://sourceforge.net/projects/cardme CardMe project]).
 * *Mac Address Book*
   * Colon characters are unnecessarily escaped in property values (credit: [https://sourceforge.net/projects/cardme CardMe project]).
 * *Kontact 4.4.8*
   * Requires that there be no whitespace after the colon in the BEGIN property when reading a vCard (credit: [http://code.google.com/p/ez-vcard/issues/detail?id=1&can=1 knutolav]).
